# TogglBoard
The most overly complicated time-tracking device ever created!

TogglBoard is a physical time-tracking device that connects to the Toggl API, so that I can quickly toggle between 7 different active projects. It's fanciest feature is the two-way sync; thanks to a motorized slider, the TogglBoard device can have it's active project overridden if I change the active project via any of the Toggl apps :tada: :robot:

It's still a work in progress, though.
